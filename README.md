Support for various services on websites with DataDome verification and Hermes.
I've been researching Hermes' encryption and risk control for a long time. The main encryption method used on this site is dynamic cookies (DataDome). The encryption itself isn't very challenging, but the difficulty lies in the risk control. No matter how strong your technical skills are, it takes a lot of time to figure it out. If you encounter DataDome on other websites, I can provide you with a demo specific to that site, allowing you to easily and 100% bypass it. If you need this service, feel free to contact me. This offer is valid for the long term!
